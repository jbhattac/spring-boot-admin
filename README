## Spring Boot Admin Console


The above actuator end points provide a lot of insights about a Spring Boot application.
But if you have many applications running, then monitoring each application by hitting the endpoints 
and inspecting the JSON response is a tedious process.

To avoid this hassle, we can use the Code Centric team  Spring Boot Admin module, which will provide us 
an admin UI dashboard to administer Spring Boot applications. 

This module crunches the data from Actuator endpoints and provides insights about all the registered 
applications in a single dashboard.
